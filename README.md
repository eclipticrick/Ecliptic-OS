## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need:
* [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) to install the dependencies for this project


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/eclipticrick/Ecliptic-OS.git ecliptic-os
```

Install the dependencies in the newly created folder

```
cd ecliptic-os
npm install
```

Run the development server locally
```
npm run start
```
Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and take a look around.

Alternatively you can go to [localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/) to see the app running there, along with any log statements.

*Note: if port 8080 is in use, the server will start at port 8081*

## Running the tests
